You wake up in a world with no way out.
 A voice echoes: “If you don’t win, you become me.”
You (the player) come to a strange space — everything looks like a game, but warped, twisted, wrong.
 The madman who rules this place calls himself The Watcher. He creates simulated realms — Creative, Hard, and Timed — forcing challengers to test themselves. Fail in one of his worlds and your consciousness is swallowed by the system, slowly assimilated into him — another copy of the madman.
The more you play, the more horrifying the truth becomes: you were once The Watcher yourself. Your memories have been shattered. Each world is a distorted fragment of your past — and as you progress, you piece together those broken recollections.

Creative World
 Symbol: Illusion of power
 Core feeling: You can do anything — but everything is meaningless.


Hard World
 Symbol: Real pain
 Core feeling: The monsters are other versions of you — reflections of past mistakes, twisted into threats.


Timed World
 Symbol: Pressure & guilt
 Core feeling: Beat the world before time runs out — the ticking clock is your past racing toward you.


The Watcher does not want to kill you. He wants you to win — because only if you overcome him can he be freed from this insane loop.
