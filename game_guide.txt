You wake up in a world with no way out.
A voice echoes: “If you do not win, you become me.”
You (the player) come to a strange space — everything looks like a game, but warped, twisted, wrong.
The madman who rules this place calls himself The Watcher.
He creates simulated realms — Creative, Hard, and Timed — forcing challengers to test themselves.
Fail in one of his worlds and your consciousness is swallowed by the system, slowly assimilated into him — another copy of the madman.
The more you play, the more horrifying the truth becomes: you were once The Watcher yourself.
Your memories have been shattered.
Each world is a distorted fragment of your past — and as you progress, you piece together those broken recollections.

Creative World - The Abandoned Prototype
Symbol: Illusion of power
Core feeling: You can do anything — but everything is meaningless.
This realm was originally a testing sandbox — a place meant for experimenting with items, terrain, and mechanics.
But after thousands of unfinished tests, it became a graveyard of discarded concepts:
empty structures, meaningless tools, and power that feels hollow.

Creative World gives you total freedom —
but it's a freedom that leads nowhere.


Hardcore World
Symbol: Real pain
Core feeling: The monsters are other versions of you — reflections of past mistakes, twisted into threats.
Each time you failed a test, fragments of your identity were left behind in the system.
Over time, those fragments decayed, twisted… and turned into the hostile creatures that roam this world.

Hardcore World is where every identity error, every corrupted memory, every failed attempt ends up.

Here, you are literally fighting your past selves.


Timed World
Symbol: Pressure & guilt
Core feeling: Beat the world before time runs out — the ticking clock is your past racing toward you.
The Watcher once ran numerous timed simulations, hoping one of them would break the cycle.
Only one of those tests remains active.
Every second that passes, your remaining memories are overwritten by the system.
You are not just fighting the clock — you are fighting your own deletion.

The Watcher does not want to kill you. He wants you to win — because only if you overcome him can he be freed from this insane loop.
